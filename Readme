I have studied many design patterns and implemented some conceptual samples of them, to determine which of the design patterns we should use, we must first identify the design problem that we are dealing with, this information usually emerges from the problem itself, but to make it easy, I have enumerated a number of design problems already identified by prior software engineers, this way, we only need to match the problem at hand with them, once the design problem is matched I have provided the design pattern related to the matched problem and also some of the consequences of the proposed design, I have also provided the basic templates to implement the pattern in Python.

The codebases utilized for generating the ground truth data. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed BSS encoding and classifier, a total of 690 labeled design pattern implementations were collected from various GitHub repositories. These code samples were organized into three distinct repositories: DB1 and DB2 were designated for proof-of-concept validation and explanation, while DB3 was employed to test the classification process. It is important to note that some individual code files may encapsulate multiple design patterns.
